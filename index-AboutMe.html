<h1>-About Me-</h1> 
<p>Hello! <u>My name is André Díaz, I’m 15 years old, I’m Honduran</u>, I live in San Salvador, El Salvador, and I study at ABC Bilingual School. I’m a very friendly person, I like helping others whenever I can, and I always enjoy making new friends. Whenever I get the chance to learn something new, I try my best to learn it, and that’s why I joined the Hackathons Club. <u>I really like listening to music, playing volleyball, and I love pasta.</u> I think my favorite things in life are my family, my phone, my headphones, and my closest friends.</p>
<p>Something else about me is that I want to study medicine and become an amazing doctor who helps many people. I love feeling useful and always making progress, I don’t like being stuck in one place. That’s why whenever I set a goal, I do everything I can to achieve it.</p>
<p>That’s all!</p>
<p2>Thank you sooo much!</p2>
